We build on concepts introduced in the [Federated Learning for Image Classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification) tutorial; as in that tutorial, we introduce high-level APIs in `tff.learning` for federated training and evaluation.\n",

    "## Background: Matrix Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "[Matrix factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)) has been a historically popular technique for learning recommendations and embedding representations for items based on user interactions. The canonical example is movie recommendation, where there are $n$ users and $m$ movies, and users have rated some movies. Given a user, we use their rating history and the ratings of similar users to predict the user's ratings for movies they haven't seen. If we have a model that can predict ratings, it's easy to recommend users new movies that they'll enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, it's useful to represent users' ratings as an $n \\times m$ matrix $R$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Matrix Factorization Motivation (CC BY-SA 3.0; Wikipedia User Moshanin)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Collaborative_filtering.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix is generally sparse, since users typically only see a small fraction of the movies in the dataset. The output of matrix factorization is two matrices: an $n \\times k$ matrix $U$ representing $k$-dimensional user embeddings for each user, and an $m \\times k$ matrix $I$ representing $k$-dimensional item embeddings for each item. The simplest training objective is to ensure that the dot product of user and item embeddings are predictive of observed ratings $O$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$argmin_{U,I}  \\sum_{(u, i) \\in O} (R_{ui} - U_u I_i^T)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error between observed ratings and ratings predicted by taking the dot product of the corresponding user and item embeddings. Another way to interpret this is that this ensures that $R \\approx UI^T$ for known ratings, hence \"matrix factorization\". If this is confusing, don't worryâ€“we won't need to know the details of matrix factorization for the rest of the tutorial."

    "## Bringing Matrix Factorization to FL\n",
    "\n",
    "While matrix factorization has been traditionally used in centralized settings, it's especially relevant in federated learning:  user ratings may live on separate client devices, and we may want to learn embeddings and recommendations for users and items without centralizing the data. Since each user has a corresponding user embedding, it's natural to have each client store their user embeddingâ€“this scales much better than a central server storing all the user embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "One proposal for bringing matrix factorization to FL goes as follows:\n",
    "1. The server stores and sends the item matrix $I$ to sampled clients each round\n",
    "2. Clients update the item matrix and their personal user embedding $U_u$ using SGD on the above objective\n",
    "3. Updates to $I$ are aggregated on the server, updating the server copy of $I$ for the next round\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is *partially local*â€“that is, some client parameters are never aggregated by the server. Though this approach is appealing, it requires clients to maintain state across rounds, namely their user embeddings. Stateful federated algorithms are less appropriate for cross-device FL settings: in these settings the population size is often much larger than the number of clients that participate in each round, and a client usually participates at most once during the training process. Besides relying on state that may not be initialized, stateful algorithms can result in performance degradation in cross-device settings due to state getting *stale* when clients are infrequently sampled. Importantly, in the matrix factorization setting, a stateful algorithm leads to all unseen clients missing trained user embeddings, and in large-scale training the majority of users may be unseen. For more on the motivation for stateless algorithms in cross-device FL, see [Wang et al. 2021 Sec. 3.1.1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06917.pdf) and [Reddi et al. 2020 Sec. 5.1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00295).\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated Reconstruction ([Singhal et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03448)) is a stateless alternative to the aforementioned approach. The key idea is that instead of storing user embeddings across rounds, clients reconstruct user embeddings when needed. When FedRecon is applied to matrix factorization, training proceeds as follows:\n",
    "1. The server stores and sends the item matrix $I$ to sampled clients each round\n",
    "2. Each client freezes $I$ and trains their user embedding $U_u$ using one or more steps of SGD (reconstruction)\n",
    "3. Each client freezes $U_u$ and trains $I$ using one or more steps of SGD\n",
    "4. Updates to $I$ are aggregated across users, updating the server copy of $I$ for the next round\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach does not require clients to maintain state across rounds. The authors also show in the paper that this method leads to fast reconstruction of user embeddings for unseen clients (Sec. 4.2, Fig. 3, and Table 1), allowing the majority of clients who do not participate in training to have a trained model, enabling recommendations for these clients. See the Federated Reconstruction [Google AI Blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/12/a-scalable-approach-for-partially-local.html) for more key results."

We need this additional information to initialize the Federated Reconstruction training process. Here we produce the `tff.learning.reconstruction.Model` from a Keras model using [`tff.learning.reconstruction.from_keras_model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/learning/reconstruction/from_keras_model).

    "Now we have everything we need to define the training process. One important difference from the [interface for Federated Averaging](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/learning/build_federated_averaging_process) is that we now pass in a `reconstruction_optimizer_fn`, which will be used when reconstructing local parameters (in our case, user embeddings). It's generally reasonable to use `SGD` here, with a similar or slightly lower learning rate than the client optimizer learning rate. We provide a working configuration below. This hasn't been carefully tuned, so feel free to play around with different values.\n",

    "## Further Explorations\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice work on completing this notebook. We suggest the following exercises to explore partially local federated learning further, roughly ordered by increasing difficulty:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Typical implementations of Federated Averaging take multiple local passes (epochs) over the data (in addition to taking one pass over the data across multiple batches). For Federated Reconstruction we may want to control the number of steps separately for reconstruction and post-reconstruction training. Passing the `dataset_split_fn` argument to the training and evaluation computation builders enables control of the number of steps and epochs over both reconstruction and post-reconstruction datasets. As an exercise, try performing 3 local epochs of reconstruction training, capped at 50 steps and 1 local epoch of post-reconstruction training, capped at 50 steps. Hint: you'll find [`tff.learning.reconstruction.build_dataset_split_fn`](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/learning/reconstruction/build_dataset_split_fn) helpful. Once you've done this, try tuning these hyperparameters and other related ones like learning rates and batch size to get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The default behavior of Federated Reconstruction training and evaluation is to split clients' local data in half for each of reconstruction and post-reconstruction. In cases where clients have very little local data, it can be reasonable to reuse data for reconstruction and post-reconstruction for the training process only (not for evaluation, this will lead to unfair evaluation). Try making this change for the training process, ensuring the `dataset_split_fn` for evaluation still keeps reconstruction and post-reconstruction data disjoint. Hint: [`tff.learning.reconstruction.simple_dataset_split_fn`](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/learning/reconstruction/simple_dataset_split_fn) might be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Above, we produced a `tff.learning.Model` from a Keras model using `tff.learning.reconstruction.from_keras_model`. We can also implement a custom model using pure TensorFlow 2.0 by [implementing the model interface](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/learning/reconstruction/Model). Try modifying `get_matrix_factorization_model` to build and return a class that extends `tff.learning.reconstruction.Model`, implementing its methods. Hint: the source code of [`tff.learning.reconstruction.from_keras_model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/learning/reconstruction/from_keras_model) provides an example of extending the `tff.learning.reconstruction.Model` class. Refer also to the [custom model implementation in the EMNIST image classification tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification#customizing_the_model_implementation) for a similar exercise in extending a `tff.learning.Model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this tutorial, we've motivated partially local federated learning in the context of matrix factorization, where sending user embeddings to the server would trivially leak user preferences. We can also apply Federated Reconstruction in other settings as a way to train more personal models (since part of the model is completely local to each user) while reducing communication (since local parameters are not sent to the server). In general, using the interface presented here we can take any federated model that would typically be trained fully globally and instead partition its variables into global variables and local variables. The example explored in the [Federated Reconstruction paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03448) is personal next word prediction: here, each user has their own local set of word embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words, enabling the model to capture users' slang and achieve personalization without additional communication. As an exercise, try implementing (as either a Keras model or a custom TensorFlow 2.0 model) a different model for use with Federated Reconstruction. A suggestion: implement an EMNIST classification model with a personal user embedding, where the personal user embedding is concatenated to the CNN image features before the last Dense layer of the model. You can reuse much of the code from this tutorial (e.g. the `UserEmbedding` class) and the [image classification tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification).\n",
